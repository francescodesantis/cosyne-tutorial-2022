    "# Coincidence detection and sound localisation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows some Python + Brian code to simulate spiking neural networks solving a sound localisation task using coincidence detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Brian](https://briansimulator.org) is a Python-based spiking neural network simulator package. It is simple to install and has extensive documentation. I recommend it for this course and more generally. It is entirely coincidental that I'm one of the authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, which leads in to the exercise for the first half of the tutorial, we'll construct a highly simplified model of sound localisation carried out by coincidence detection and delay lines. This model was proposed by [Jeffress (1948)]() and is explained in more detail [here](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Jeffress_model).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that you have an incoming auditory signal arriving from some angle $\\theta$, so it arrives at one ear earlier than the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ITD](itd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the difference in arrival time the *interaural time difference* or ITD. In this notebook, the signal will be a sine wave at frequency $f$ and so this time difference is ambiguous and becomes an *interaural phase difference* (IPD). The two are related by $\\mathrm{IPD}=2\\pi f\\cdot\\mathrm{ITD}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jeffress' model the brain tries to infer the ITD by compensating with multiple neural delay lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jeffress](jeffress.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each circle is a coincidence detector neuron, and the signal travels along the lines at a fixed speed. So, the signal from the left ear reaches the leftmost coincidence detector neuron first, and the rightmost neuron last. The signal from the right ear is the opposite, it reaches the rightmost neuron first and the leftmost neuron last. For each neuron there is a *best ITD* where the neural delays exactly compensate the acoustic delays (ITD). Since coincidence detector neurons fire more frequently if they are receiving inputs that are more similar, you can estimate the ITD of the sound by which neuron is firing at the highest rate (you estimate that the ITD of the sound is the best ITD of that neuron).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding it up\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this notebook, we'll turn this idea into code."

    "Now we set up the input signal model. We'll have the two ears receive two sine waves with different phase delays, ear 0 will have no delay, and ear 1 will have a delay of ``ipd``. Then, we'll have the neurons generate spikes as a Poisson process with firing rate ``rate_max*0.5*(1+sin(theta))``. We model this in Brian by having a spike threshold condition ``rand()<rate*dt`` where ``rand()`` is a uniform random number in ``[0, 1]`` and ``dt`` is the simulation time step.
